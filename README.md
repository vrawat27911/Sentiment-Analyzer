# Sentiment-Analyzer

Sentiment Analysis using Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier and Binarized Mulitnomial Naive Bayes Classifier as part of NLP coursework. 

I have also implemented sentiment analyzer using Sentiment-Phrasal-Lexicon-Induction.
This is based on Turney, Peter D. 2002. “Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down? Semantic Orientation Applied to Unsupervised Classification of Reviews.” Proceedings of the 40th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL).
It can classify documents based on the sentiments ‘positive’ or ‘negative’. I could achieve following results.

* Nearness limit: 10, Phrase Polarity Count Threshold: 4
    * Accuracy: 0.523000
* Nearness limit: 15, Phrase Polarity Count Threshold: 4
    * Accuracy: 0.531500
